# Indoor-Air-Quality-Monitoring

I used a microcontroller and gas sensors along with temperature and humidity sensor that will monitor the indoor air quality. The microcontroller I used is ESP32. The gas sensors are MQ135 for detection of carbon monoxide, benzene, ammonia, alcohol; MQ5 for detection of natural gas, LPG; MQ2 for methane, butane, smoke. The DHT11 sensor is used to get the temperature and humidity. Based on the values collected from sensors the microcontroller will decide the air quality based on previously hard coded thresholds. I used a 16x2 LCD display and a series of LEDs to visualize  the results and display the AQI, temperature, humidity and alert messages along with indications in LEDS.
